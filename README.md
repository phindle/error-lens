# ErrorLens README

Welcome to ErrorLens.

ErrorLens enhances Visual Studio Code's inbuilt diagnostic highlighting. Visual Studio Code's default behavior is to
underline errors and warnings and other diagnostic messages using a 'squiggly underline'. Whilst this is certainly
useful, the underline visual effect is subtle, and therefore can be easily overlooked in a busy file.

ErrorLens turbo-charges the language diagnostic features, by making diagnostics stand out more prominently, highlighting
the entire line wherever a diagnostic is generated by the language and also prints the diagnostic message(s) in-line at
the site of the line of code which is generating the diagnostic.

## Deprecation Note

Error Lens was originally conceived and developed by Phil Hindle.

I no longer maintain this extension. A fork of this repo has been developed greatly since I stopped working on this in 2019. I recommend installing Alexander's fork of this extension from <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens>
(Repo URL for the extension is: <https://github.com/usernamehw/vscode-error-lens>)

## Features

* Lines containing errors or warnings or info are highlighted more obviously.
* Diagnostic descriptions are appended to the end of any line containing diagnostic info, meaning that you do not have to context-switch to the problem view.
* The status bar shows the number of diagnostics for the open file. (This can be configured)
* Settings can be configured to control the way ErrorLens displays enhanced diagnostics.
* Works for any language which provides diagnostics.

## Requirements

Built using Visual Studio Code 1.31.

Tested on Windows 10 (64-bit), Linux Mint & OSX 10.13.

## Release Notes

Please refer to CHANGELOG.md for more details.

### 1.1.0

Second release of ErrorLens (February 2019).

*NOTE*: Configuration property `errorLens.errorMsgPrefix` has been removed. The reason is that this was somewhat unnecessary, and just added noise to the annotations. (cf. <https://github.com/phindle/error-lens/issues/9>)

### 1.0.0

Initial release of ErrorLens (October 2018)
