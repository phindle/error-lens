# ErrorLens README

Welcome to ErrorLens.

ErrorLens enhances Visual Studio Code's inbuilt diagnostic highlighting. Visual Studio Code's default behavior for is to underline errors/warnings/info using a 'squiggly underline'. Whilst this is useful, it is sometimes possible to overlook errors and warnings.

ErrorLens turbo-charges the language diagnostic features, by making diagnostics stand out more prominently, highlighting the entire line wherever a diagnostic is generated by the language and also prints the diagnostic message(s) in-line at the site of the line of code which is generating the diagnostic.

## Features

* Lines containing errors or warnings or info are highlighted more obviously.
* Diagnostic descriptions are appended to the end of any line containing diagnostic info, meaning that you do not have to context-switch to the problem view.
* The status bar shows the number of diagnostics for the open file. (This can be configured)
* Settings can be configured to control the way ErrorLens displays enhanced diagnostics.
* Works for any language which provides diagnostics.

## Release Notes

### 1.1.0

Second release of ErrorLens (February 2019). Please refer to CHANGELOG.md for more details.

*NOTE*: Configuration property `errorLens.errorMsgPrefix` has been removed. The reason is that this was somewhat unnecessary, and just added noise to the annotations. (cf. https://github.com/phindle/error-lens/issues/9)
